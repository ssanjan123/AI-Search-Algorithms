From the above table, we can conclude that choosing the Manhattan and the max of both the 
heuristics are far superior to the misplaced heuristic. The Max heuristic has outperformed the 
Manhattan very slightly. In most cases, since Manhattan heuristic is extremely dominant over the 
Misplaced heuristic this causes the max of both to choose the Manhattan heuristic value in most 
cases and that is why their (Manhattan and Max) results in the table are so closely related and 
similar. 
• The solutions found by this algorithm (A* with the matching heuristic) is not 
always optimal as it is only looking into the matching colors per facets and doesn’t have 
more information on each block’s location or the position that it needs to move to get to a 
goal state. Just the information on the matching facets is sufficient sometimes but for 
more complex Rubik’s cube problem our solution can run for very long with inefficient 
results. For these reasons our algorithm is not optimal and heuristics like Manhattan 
distance might give a more optimal solution
