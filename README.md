This repository contains a solution for solving various problems using the A* search algorithm. The project was developed using Python and various heuristic functions were used to guide the search towards the optimal solution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Any Python IDE (PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
git clone https://github.com/ssanjan123>/ai-search-algorithms.git

### Usage

The repository contains the code for running the A* search algorithm using three different heuristic functions - Misplaced, Manhattan, and the max of the other two. To run the code, use the following command:

python main.py


The code will prompt you to select which heuristic function you want to use and will provide information such as the number of paths expanded and the elapsed time for solving the problem.

## Results

The results of running the code using different heuristic functions and initial states are provided in the above text, it shows that using the Manhattan heuristic function results in the fastest and most efficient solution for the given set of initial states. However, it's important to note that these results may vary depending on the specific problem and initial state.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the A* search algorithm can be used to solve various problems and how the use of different heuristic functions can affect the efficiency of the search process. The project was developed using python and the sample dataset used here is for demonstration purposes only.
